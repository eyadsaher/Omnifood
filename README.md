## 📌 My Journey

- I started with a helpful Udemy course called "Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS" by Jonas Schmedtmann. You can find it [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/). It's not a paid promotion; it's just a really good course.
- During this course, I worked on the Omnifood project, which helped me get better at design and more confident with big projects.
- This project gave me the skills to create complex layouts and understand the basics of making webpages. The course showed me lots of different designs and layouts, making me better at what I do. 👊
